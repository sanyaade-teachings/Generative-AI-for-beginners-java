# Setting Up the Development Environment for Generative AI for Java

> **Quick Start:** Provision your AI models on **Azure AI Foundry** as code with Bicep + `azd` in a few minutes — see the [Azure AI Foundry Setup Guide](getting-started-azure-openai.md). Authentication is **keyless** (Microsoft Entra ID), so there are no API keys to manage.

## What You'll Learn

- Set up a Java development environment for AI applications
- Choose and configure your preferred development environment (cloud-first with Codespaces, local dev container, or full local setup)
- Test your setup by connecting to an Azure AI Foundry model

## Introduction

This chapter will guide you through setting up a development environment. We'll use **Azure AI Foundry** for the models throughout this course. You provision the models as code with Bicep and the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), then connect with **keyless authentication** (Microsoft Entra ID) — no API keys to copy or leak.

**No local setup required!** You can use GitHub Codespaces, which provides a full development environment in your browser, and provision Foundry from there.

We use **Azure AI Foundry** for this course because it's:
- **Provisioned as code** — one `azd up` deploys the account and model deployments
- **Keyless** — authenticate with your Azure sign-in or a managed identity
- **Production-ready** — the same code runs locally and in Azure
- **Flexible** — swap models by changing a deployment name, not your code

> **Note**: Azure AI Foundry deployments are billed per token (pay-as-you-go). See the [Azure AI Foundry setup guide](getting-started-azure-openai.md) for provisioning, region, and cost details.


## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

<a name="quick-start-cloud"></a>

We've created a preconfigured development container to minimize setup time and ensure you have all the necessary tools for this Generative AI for Java course. Choose your preferred development approach:

### Environment Setup Options:

#### Option A: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

**Start coding in 2 minutes - no local setup required!**

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
   > **Note**: If you want to edit the basic config please have a look at the [Dev Container Configuration](../../../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
2. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** tab → **...** → **New with options...**
3. Use the defaults – this will select the **Dev container configuration**: **Generative AI Java Development Environment** custom devcontainer created for this course
4. Click **Create codespace**
5. Wait ~2 minutes for the environment to be ready
6. Proceed to [Step 2: Provision Azure AI Foundry](#step-2-provision-azure-ai-foundry)

<img src="../../../translated_images/en/codespaces-create.b44a36f728660ab7.webp" alt="Screenshot: Create codespace options" width="50%">


> **Benefits of Codespaces**:
> - No local installation required
> - Works on any device with a browser
> - Pre-configured with all tools and dependencies
> - Free 60 hours per month for personal accounts
> - Consistent environment for all learners

#### Option B: Local Dev Container

**For developers who prefer local development with Docker**

1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine
   > **Note**: If you want to edit the basic config please have a look at the [Dev Container Configuration](../../../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VS Code
4. Open the repository folder in VS Code
5. When prompted, click **Reopen in Container** (or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")
6. Wait for the container to build and start
7. Proceed to [Step 2: Provision Azure AI Foundry](#step-2-provision-azure-ai-foundry)

<img src="../../../translated_images/en/devcontainer.21126c9d6de64494.webp" alt="Screenshot: Dev container setup" width="50%">

<img src="../../../translated_images/en/image-3.bf93d533bbc84268.webp" alt="Screenshot: Dev container build complete" width="50%">

#### Option C: Use Your Existing Local Installation

**For developers with existing Java environments**

Prerequisites:
- [Java 21+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html) 
- [Maven 3.9+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or your preferred IDE

Steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Proceed to [Step 2: Provision Azure AI Foundry](#step-2-provision-azure-ai-foundry)

> **Pro Tip**: If you have a low-spec machine but want VS Code locally, use GitHub Codespaces! You can connect your local VS Code to a cloud-hosted Codespace for the best of both worlds.

## Step 2: Provision Azure AI Foundry

Deploy the course's AI models to Azure AI Foundry as code. From the repository root:

```bash
cd 02-SetupDevEnvironment
azd auth login
az login
azd up
```

`azd` prompts for an environment name and region, provisions an Azure AI Foundry account with `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small` deployments, and writes the endpoint into the example's `.env` — all with **keyless** authentication (no API keys).

> **Full walkthrough:** See the [Azure AI Foundry Setup Guide](getting-started-azure-openai.md) for prerequisites, a manual (portal) alternative, region guidance, and cost/cleanup notes.

## Step 3: Test Your Setup

Once your Foundry models are provisioned, test the connection with the example app in [`02-SetupDevEnvironment/examples/basic-chat-azure`](../../../02-SetupDevEnvironment/examples/basic-chat-azure).

1. Open the terminal in your development environment.
2. Navigate to the example:
   ```bash
   cd 02-SetupDevEnvironment/examples/basic-chat-azure
   ```
3. Make sure you're signed in (keyless auth needs a token):
   ```bash
   az login
   ```
   > If you ran `azd up`, the `.env` file with your endpoint was already written for you.
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean spring-boot:run
   ```

You should see a response from the `gpt-4o-mini` model.

### Understanding the Example Code

The example under `examples/basic-chat-azure` is a Spring Boot app that uses **Spring AI** to connect to Azure AI Foundry with keyless authentication.

**What this code does:**
- **Connects** to Azure AI Foundry using your Azure sign-in (Microsoft Entra ID) — no API key
- **Sends** a prompt to the `gpt-4o-mini` model
- **Receives** and displays the AI's response
- **Validates** your setup is working correctly

**Key Dependency** (in `pom.xml`):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-azure-openai</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Configuration** (`application.yml`):
```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    azure:
      openai:
        # Endpoint only - no api-key. Spring AI uses DefaultAzureCredential (keyless).
        endpoint: ${AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}
        chat:
          options:
            deployment-name: ${AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT:gpt-4o-mini}
```

## Summary

Great! You now have everything set up:

- Provisioned Azure AI Foundry models as code with Bicep + `azd`
- Got your Java development environment running (whether that's Codespaces, dev containers, or local)
- Connected to Azure AI Foundry with keyless authentication (Microsoft Entra ID) — no API keys
- Tested it all works with a simple example that talks to your model

## Next Steps

[Chapter 3: Core Generative AI Techniques](../03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/README.md)

## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are common problems and solutions:

- **Authentication failing (401/403)?** 
  - Run `az login` — authentication is keyless, so you must be signed in
  - Verify your account has the **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** role on the resource
  - If you just provisioned, wait a minute for the role assignment to propagate

- **Maven not found?** 
  - If using dev containers/Codespaces, Maven should be pre-installed
  - For local setup, ensure Java 21+ and Maven 3.9+ are installed
  - Try `mvn --version` to verify installation

- **`azd` not found or provisioning fails?** 
  - Install the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install) and run `azd auth login`
  - Pick a region where `gpt-4o-mini` is available (e.g. `eastus2`)
  - See the [Azure AI Foundry setup guide](getting-started-azure-openai.md) for details

- **Dev container not starting?** 
  - Ensure Docker Desktop is running (for local development)
  - Try rebuilding the container: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

- **Application compilation errors?**
  - Ensure you're in the correct directory: `02-SetupDevEnvironment/examples/basic-chat-azure`
  - Try cleaning and rebuilding: `mvn clean compile`
